My name is Luana Totea. I graduated in September 2018 from University College London 
with a joint degree in Computer Science and Business from their Engineering department. 
During my time as an undergraduate student I worked part time at UCL as an IT training 
assistant for their Research Department. I aldo did a placement year at Goldman Sachs 
in their Securities Division and then joined the firm full time for two years. 
Next year I will be graduating from London Business School with a Masters degree in 
Finance. In parallel I will be studying MA Art Business at Sothebys institute. 
I want to use this platform to share my work on various topics I'm intereted in. 
I view it as an immersive canvas touching on subjects from Finance, Climate Change 
(&Sustainability), Art and the Art Market and Fashion.
